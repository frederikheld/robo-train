## Development

This repository uses the Git LFS extension for binary files, mainly because _Fritzing_ diagrams are compressed bundles.

Please activate Git LFS before you commit changes to any of the file types listed in [.gitattributes](.gitattrbiutes)!

If you don't know how to install and activate Git LFS, please take a look at https://git-lfs.github.com/.
